# CiscoConfigGenerator

This Program is a Tool that can load two types of Config.txt files and replace the string "$$$" with Interface-Ranges and Interfaces.

The config template files are located under /bin/debug/PortTemplate.txt and PortTemplateAP.txt.
The newConfig is also located under /bin/debug/

To Start the Program open it with VisualStudio and run.
This Program is still a WIP!
